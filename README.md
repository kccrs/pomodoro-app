## Description

This customizable Pomodoro app allows the user to set a focus duration and a break duration, or use the default times of 25 minutes of focus followed by 5 minutes of break.  The timer then counts down the remaining time.  A sound plays at the end of the time to let the user know to switch to the next phase.  The user can also pause the timer at any point and restart from the pause point.
